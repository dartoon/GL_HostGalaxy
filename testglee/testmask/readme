the steps to get the mask:(suitable for two regions)
1. use ds9 to get the region we want to mask ([upline]region-shape-polygon).
2. save the region to *.reg ([midline]-region-save-out1.reg)
3. save the other region 	#ds9poly can only work with one circle
4. go to shell: 
		../testmask/ds9poly out1.reg > out1
		../testmask/ds9poly out2.reg > out2
		../testmask/fillpoly out1 mask1.txt
		../testmask/fillpoly out2 mask2.txt    #mask1 and mask2 give all the pixels in the mask

		run crtmask.py
