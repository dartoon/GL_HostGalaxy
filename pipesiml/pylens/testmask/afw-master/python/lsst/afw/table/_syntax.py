    Any number of glob patterns may be passed; the result will be the union of all
    the result of each glob considered separately.

    Note that extract("*", copy=True) provides an easy way to transform a row-major
    ColumnView into a possibly more efficient set of contiguous NumPy arrays.

    This routines unpacks Flag columns into full boolean arrays and covariances into dense
    (i.e. non-triangular packed) arrays with dimension (N,M,M), where N is the number of
    records and M is the dimension of the covariance matrix.  Fields with named subfields
    (e.g. points) are always split into separate dictionary items, as is done in
    BaseRecord.extract(..., split=True).  String fields are silently ignored.

    Additional optional arguments may be passed as keywords:

      items ------ The result of a call to self.schema.extract(); this will be used instead
                   of doing any new matching, and allows the pattern matching to be reused
                   to extract values from multiple records.  This keyword is incompatible
                   with any position arguments and the regex, sub, and ordered keyword
                   arguments.

      where ------ Any expression that can be passed as indices to a NumPy array, including
                   slices, boolean arrays, and index arrays, that will be used to index
                   each column array.  This is applied before arrays are copied when
                   copy is True, so if the indexing results in an implicit copy no
                   unnecessary second copy is performed.

      copy ------- If True, the returned arrays will be contiguous copies rather than strided
                   views into the catalog.  This ensures that the lifetime of the catalog is
                   not tied to the lifetime of a particular catalog, and it also may improve
                   the performance if the array is used repeatedly.
                   Default is False.

      regex ------ A regular expression to be used in addition to any glob patterns passed
                   as positional arguments.  Note that this will be compared with re.match,
                   not re.search.
