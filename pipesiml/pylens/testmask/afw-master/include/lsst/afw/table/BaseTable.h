/**
 *  @brief Base class for all tables.
 *
 *  Tables have two largely distinct purposes:
 *   - They serve as factories for records, allocating their field data in blocks.
 *   - They carry additional information (such as the schema) that should be shared by multiple records.
 *
 *  It's mostly a matter of convenience that we use the same class to serve both needs.
 *
 *  Tables do not actually maintain a list of all the records they have allocated - but those records
 *  hold a pointer back to the table.  This allows the work of holding and iterating over records to
 *  be delegated to templated container classes (such as CatalogT) while allowing tables to be polymorphic,
 *  non-template classes.  In some sense, then, it may make more sense to think of a table as a combination
 *  factory and "container header".
 *
 *  Tables are always created in shared_ptrs (a requirement of enable_shared_from_this).  BaseTable provides
 *  a make static member function to create a new table, and most derived table classes should do the same.
 *
 *  Each table class should be associated with a particular record class (1-to-1).  Each table instance may
 *  be associated with many record instances.
