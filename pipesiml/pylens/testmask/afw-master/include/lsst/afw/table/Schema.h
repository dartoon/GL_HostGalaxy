/**
 *  @brief Defines the fields and offsets for a table.
 *
 *  Schema behaves like a container of SchemaItem objects, mapping a descriptive Field object
 *  with the Key object used to access record and ColumnView values.  A Schema is the most
 *  important ingredient in creating a table.
 *
 *  Because offsets for fields are assigned when the field is added to the Schema, 
 *  Schemas do not support removing fields, though they do allow renaming.
 *
 *  Field names in Schemas are expected to be dot-separated names (e.g. 'a.b.c').  The SubSchema
 *  class and Schema::operator[] provide a heirarchical interface to these names, but are
 *  implemented entirely as string splitting/joining operations that ultimately forward to
 *  member functions that operate on the fully-qualified field name, so there is no requirement
 *  that names be separated by periods, and no performance advantage to using a SubSchema.
 *
 *  A SchemaMapper object can be used to define a relationship between two Schemas to be used
 *  when copying values from one table to another or loading/saving selected fields to disk.
 *
 *  Schema uses copy-on-write, and hence should always be held by value rather than smart pointer.
 *  When creating a Python interface, functions that return Schema by const reference should be
 *  converted to return by value (%returnCopy) to ensure proper memory management and encapsulation.
