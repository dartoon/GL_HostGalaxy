/**
 *  @brief A collection of all the things that make an Exposure different from a MaskedImage
 *
 *  The constness semantics of the things held by ExposureInfo are admittedly a bit of a mess,
 *  but they're that way to preserve backwards compatibility for now.  Eventually I'd like to make
 *  a lot of these things immutable, but in the meantime, here's the summary:
 *   - Wcs, Calib, and Psf are held by non-const pointer, and you can get a non-const pointer via a
 *     non-const member function accessor and a const pointer via a const member function accessor.
 *   - Detector is held by const pointer and only returned by const pointer (but if you're
 *     in Python, SWIG will have casted all that constness away).
 *   - Filter is held and returned by value.
 *   - Metadata is held by non-const pointer, and you can get a non-const pointer via a const
 *     member function accessor (i.e. constness is not propagated).
 *
 *  The setters for Wcs and Calib clone their input arguments (this is a departure from the
 *  previous behavior for Calib and Wcs but it's safer w.r.t. aliasing and it matches the old
 *  (and current) behavior of the Exposure and ExposureInfo constructors, which clone their
 *  arguments.  The setter for Psf and constructors do not clone the Psf, as Psfs are immutable
 *  and hence we don't need to ensure strict ownership.  The setter for Detector does *not*
 *  clone its input argument, because while it technically isn't, we can safely consider a
 *  Detector to be immutable once it's attached to an ExposureInfo.

     *      to the Exposure for the next step.
     *   2. Exposure calls MaskedImage::writeFits to save the Image, Mask, and Variance HDUs along
     *      with the headers.
     *   3. Exposure calls ExposureInfo::_finishWriteFits to save the archive to additional table HDUs.
