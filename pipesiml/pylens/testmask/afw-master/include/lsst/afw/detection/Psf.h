/**
 *  @brief A polymorphic base class for representing an image's Point Spread Function
 *
 *  Most of a Psf's functionality involves its evaluation at a position and color, either
 *  or both of which may be unspecified (which will result in evaluation at some average
 *  position or color).  Unlike the closely-related Kernel class, there is no requirement
 *  that a Psf have a well-defined spatial function or any parameters.  Psfs are not
 *  necessarily continuous, and the dimensions of image of the Psf at a point may not be
 *  fixed.
 *
 *  Psfs have two methods for getting at image at a point:
 *   - the image returned by computeImage() is in the same coordinate system as the pixelized image
 *   - the image returned by computeKernelImage() is in an offset coordinate system with the point
 *     P at (0,0); this implies that the image (x0,y0) will be negative
 *
 *  Because P does not need to have integer coordinates, these two images are fractionally offset
 *  from each other and we use interpolation to get (1) from (2).

 *  Psfs are immutable - derived classes should have no non-const methods, and hence
 *  should be fully-defined after construction.  This allows shared_ptrs to Psfs to be
 *  passed around and shared between objects without concern for whether they will be
 *  unexpectedly modified.
 *
 *  In most cases, Psf derived classes should inherit from meas::algorithms::ImagePsf
 *  or meas::algorithms::KernelPsf, as these will provide default implementions for
 *  several member functions.
