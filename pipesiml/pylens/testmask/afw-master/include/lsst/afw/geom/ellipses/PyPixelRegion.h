// This is a bit of swig-only C++ code that ideally we'd put in a %inline block,
// but it turns out %inline blocks don't get pulled in by %import statements,
// causing problems downstream problems in any module that %imports ellipsesLib.i
// or PixelRegion.i.  So instead, we separate it into a .h file that must be
// #included inside a %{ %} block in any module that includes ellipsesLib.i.
// Still ugly, but at least it makes it possible for downstream modules to include
// ellipsesLib.i.  If someone has a better solution, I'd love to hear about it.
// Note that we also have to put it in include/ rather than python/, because we
// need it to be in the include path when we compile SWIG modules, not just when
// we generate them.
